 nestorian_religion_desc:0 "Nestorianism is a Christian doctrine stemming from the teachings of Nestorius, claiming that the divine and human nature of Jesus are separate. They were rejected by the more mainline branches of Christianity, but their doctrine soon merged with the Church of the East, becoming the most popular form of Syriac Christianity. By 1444 Nestorianism is mainly prevalent in and near the Eurasian Steppes, having long since spread beyond the Levant."

 icon_nestorius_desc: "St. Nestorius was a bishop of Constantinople in the 5th century. He is best known for his teachings on the nature of Jesus Christ, which were considered heretical by many other Christians at the time.\n\nNestorius taught that Jesus Christ was not one person, but rather two persons: one divine and one human. He believed that the divine and human natures of Christ were separate and distinct, and that they were united in Christ only by faith. This belief, known as Nestorianism, was opposed by many other Christian leaders, who believed that Jesus was fully divine and fully human in one person.\n\nNestorius was condemned as a heretic at the Council of Ephesus in 431, and was later exiled to a monastery in Egypt. Despite his condemnation, some Christians continued to follow his teachings, and Nestorianism spread throughout the Middle East and Asia. Today, there are several churches that follow Nestorian teachings, including the Assyrian Church of the East."

He was the son of the previous patriarch, and was the first of the 'Mar Shimun' line of patriarchs, who held the position for over 500 years.\n\nDuring his tenure as patriarch, Mar Shimun worked to strengthen the Church of the East and expand its influence. He also established a system of hereditary succession for the patriarchate, which caused some controversy and led to a split in the church. Despite these challenges, Mar Shimun is remembered as a significant figure in the history of the Church of the East and its growth and development."

The letter is addressed to 'those who are called, who are loved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ,' and encourages its readers to defend the faith and remain faithful to God.\n\nHe is the patron saint of desperate cases and lost causes, and is often invoked for help in difficult or hopeless situations.
